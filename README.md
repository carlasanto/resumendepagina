# resumendepagina
In this project we take as an example a wikipedia page and we make a summary of it.
I used the BeautifulSoup, inscriptis, googletrans and nltk libraries.
I cleaned the text of annoying characters, brackets and extra spaces.
I calculated the frequency of the words and phrases that are repeated the most. With this, make the summary.
Finally I added the option to translate the summary.
